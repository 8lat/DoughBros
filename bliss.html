          <h2>Instructions</h2><br>
          <ol start="1">
            <li class="instruction"><b>Create the Starter</b>: Firstly, go ahead and mix 25 grams of Whole Grain Flower with 25 grams of Warm Water. Once combined, the starter will begin to ferment, and cause the bread to rise.</li>
            <li class="instruction"><b>Maintaining the Starter</b>: To maintain your starter, keep it at room temperature and feed it daily, to feed it, you must half your starter, <i>Split your starter in half, and either throw it out or make another dough with it</i>. Next, you add the same amount of water and flour, as there are grams in your newly halved starter. Continue this process for 6 days.  
            </li>
            <li class="instruction"><b>Creating the Dough</b>: Whisk the starter and all of your water together in a large bowl, as you mix, begin to add your flour and your salt. Let rest for 30 minutes, and work the dough into a fairly smooth ball.</li>
            <li class="instruction"><b>Bulk Rise</b>: Put the dough into a bowl and cover it with a damp towel. Let the bowl sit overnight at room temperature. <i>(8-10 hours)</i> You will know the dough is ready, when it has doubled in size, you do not need to be precise about it, you should be able to tell.</li>
            <li class="instruction"><b>Shape & Assemble</b>: Remove the dough onto a lightly flowered surface. Let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Longer rested this stage will relax it, though, making it easier to stretch into a rectangle. Line a 10 inch oval proofing a proofing basket with a towel and dust with flower combine the sugar and cinnamon into a small bowl. Set side. <be><br> With flowered hand gently stretch the dough into a long rectangle about 16 X8 inches. Lightly brush the surface of the dough with water then evenly sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture over the top, leaving 2 inch porter at the top and bottom edge and a 1 inch border around the side. With the short and facing you roll the dough to a log pinching the end to seal. Place it in the basket.</li>
            <li class="instruction"><b>Rise your Dough</b>: Put your dough in a covered bowl, and let rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour. The dough is ready when it is risen slightly, if your bread hasn't risen after an hour, we recommend you recheck the steps.</li>
            <li class="instruction"><b>Preheat the Oven</b>: Preheat your oven to 450Â°F. Before putting the dough in the oven, you must score/put a pattern on the sourdough to ensure it is cooked all the way through.</li>
            <li class="instruction"><b>Bake your Dough</b>: Bake the dough in a Dutch oven, on the center rack of your oven for 20 minutes. <i>(Cover the pot)</i> After 20 minutes is up, remove the cover, and continue to bake for 30 minutes. Then, carefully remove the loaf from the pot.</li>
          <li class="instruction"><b>Finish Cooling</b>: When done, take the loaf out of the oven, and let cool for 1 hour.</li>
          <li class="instruction"><b>Enjoy your Loaf</b>: Plate the loaf, and cut into desired sizes. We recommend serving with Nutella, Bananas, or something pleasant of your choosing.</li>
