          <h2>Instructions</h2><br>
          <ol start="1">
            <li class="instruction"><b>Create the Starter</b>: Firstly, go ahead and mix 25 grams of Whole Grain Flower with 25 grams of Warm Water. Once combined, the starter will begin to ferment, and cause the bread to rise.</li>
            <li class="instruction"><b>Maintaining the Starter</b>: To maintain your starter, keep it at room temperature and feed it daily, to feed it, you must half your starter, <i>Split your starter in half, and either throw it out or make another dough with it</i>. Next, you add the same amount of water and flour, as there are grams in your newly halved starter. Continue this process for 6 days.  
            </li>
            <li class="instruction"><b>Creating the Dough</b>: Whisk the starter and all of your water together in a large bowl, as you mix, begin to add your flour and your salt. Let rest for 30 minutes, and work the dough into a fairly smooth ball.</li>
            <li class="instruction"><b>Bulk Rise</b>: Put the dough into a bowl and cover it with a damp towel. Let the bowl sit overnight at room temperature. <i>(8-10 hours)</i> You will know the dough is ready, when it has doubled in size, you do not need to be precise about it, you should be able to tell.</li>
            <li class="instruction"><b>Shape the Dough</b>: After 8-10 hours coax the dough into your preferred shape. We recommend a type of oval/sphere.</li>
            <li class="instruction"><b>Rise your Dough</b>: Put your dough in a covered bowl, and let rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour. The dough is ready when it is risen slightly, if your bread hasn't risen after an hour, we recommend you recheck the steps.</li>
            <li class="instruction"><b>Preheat the Oven</b>: Preheat your oven to 450Â°F. Before putting the dough in the oven, you may score/put a pattern on the sourdough if you prefer.</li>
            <li class="instruction"><b>Bake your Dough</b>: Bake the dough in a Dutch oven, on the center rack of your oven for 20 minutes. <i>(Cover the pot)</i> After 20 minutes is up, remove the cover, and continue to bake for 25 minutes. Then, carefully remove the loaf from the pot. </li>
          <li class="instruction"><b>Finish Baking</b>: When done, take the loaf out of the oven, and let cool for 1 hour.</li>
          <li class="instruction"><b>Enjoy your Loaf</b>: Plate the loaf, and cut into desired sizes. We recommend serving with Balsamic, Vinegar, Butter, or Jam.</li>
